## 1. Problem Statement

Traditional road inspection methods rely on manual, time-consuming visual surveys, which are expensive, dangerous, and prone to human error. This leads to delayed identification and repair of critical road defects like potholes and cracks.

The problem is to develop an automated, precise, and objective system capable of rapidly assessing road surfaces from digital images to:
1.  **Detect and localize** structural defects.
2.  **Quantify** the severity (area) of the defects.
3.  **Generate actionable reports** for timely maintenance planning.

## 2. Scope of the Project

The **Road-D-Loc** system focuses on applying deep learning-based **Image Segmentation methods** to classify pixels within a **single static image of a road segment** into categories: 'Pothole', 'Crack', and 'Background'.

### Inclusions:
* Implementation of a U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for pixel-level classification.
* Development of a comprehensive data workflow including image preprocessing and defect quantification.
* Generation of a structured `Defect_Report.csv` file, providing quantitative analysis (area in pixels and percentage) for maintenance planning.

### Exclusions (Out of Scope):
* Real-time video processing or streaming data.
* 3D reconstruction or depth estimation (focus is purely on 2D segmentation).
* Integration with external mapping or GPS systems.

## 3. Target Users

The primary users of the Road-D-Loc system are organizations responsible for maintaining civil infrastructure and road safety:

* **Municipal Engineering Departments:** To automate inspection, prioritize repair sites, and allocate budgets efficiently.
* **Road Maintenance Contractors:** To receive objective data for repair jobs.
* **Government Transportation Agencies:** For high-level oversight and assessment of road network quality.

## 4. High-Level Features (Functional Modules)

The system is built around **three major functional modules** to fulfill the project objective:

1.  **Module 1: Image Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Handles image loading, resizing, normalization, and other transformations necessary for the segmentation model.
2.  **Module 2: Segmentation Model (Prediction):** The core U-Net model classifies every pixel in the input image as a Pothole, Crack, or Background.
3.  **Module 3: Defect Quantification and Reporting:** Calculates the area of the segmented defects and outputs a clear, structured record (`Defect_Report.csv`) suitable for analytics.
